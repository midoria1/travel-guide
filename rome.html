        Rome is the capital of Italy, rich in history and culture, and known as the "Eternal City" due to its long-lasting 
        influence on world civilization. It was founded in 753 BC and was the center of the Roman Empire, which dominated large 
        parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Key landmarks include the Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum, 
        and Vatican City, the latter being the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. The city is famous for its ancient ruins,
         Renaissance art, and delicious Roman cuisine, such as carbonara and cacio e pepe. Today, Rome is a bustling metropolis, 
         serving as a political, economic, and cultural hub in Italy with a population of about 2.8 million people
